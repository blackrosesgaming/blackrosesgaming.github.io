    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>
      We're the Black Roses Gaming Community, a Discord server community.
      <br />
      We play all kinds of games from tripple-a titles to .io games, if you're a gamer (or just a chill person) this might be the right server for you to play or just hang out with cool people.
      <br />
      We currently have a running Minecraft server where you can join and have fun.
      <br />
      We also have a good moderation and role system. And hey just give a small server a try you might actually like it.
      <br />
      Any questions? DM Protege#0601 or devery0ne#1093 on discord. So what are you waiting for? Join us below!
